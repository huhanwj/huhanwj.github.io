== About Me

I am currently a PhD student in Department of Information Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) under the supervision of [Prof. He Chen](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/people/hchen.shtml).
I obtained Bachelor of Engineering in Information Engineering with first class honors from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I had the first experience of research work
by taking hands on a belief propagation simulation with [Prof. Pascal O. Vontobel](https://sites.google.com/site/pascalvontobel/). # <<-- Replace this with your "About Me" paragraph
